### Conceptual Exercise

Answer the following questions below:

- What is PostgreSQL?

 PostgreSQL as a highly organized system for storing and managing large amounts of information, kind of like a super-smart filing cabinet for computer data. This system helps people and programs keep track of lots of different types of information and makes it easy to find and use that information later.

- What is the difference between SQL and PostgreSQL?

  PostgreSQL is an implementation of a database management system, and SQL is the language you use to interact with that system. When you use PostgreSQL, you write SQL queries and commands to perform tasks like creating tables, querying data, and managing database objects

- In `psql`, how do you connect to a database?

 \c database_name

- What is the difference between `HAVING` and `WHERE`?

 WHERE: Used to filter individual rows before they are processed in the query. It works with all rows in the table and is used without the GROUP     BY clause.
 
 HAVING: Used to filter the results of aggregate functions applied to grouped data. It is used with the GROUP BY clause and operates on groups of rows after aggregation.

- What is the difference between an `INNER` and `OUTER` join?

 INNER JOIN: Returns only rows with matching values in both tables.
OUTER JOIN: Returns all rows from one table and the matching rows from the other table, including unmatched rows with NULL values.

- What is the difference between a `LEFT OUTER` and `RIGHT OUTER` join?

 LEFT OUTER JOIN: Retains all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table, including unmatched rows from the left table with NULL values.
RIGHT OUTER JOIN: Retains all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table, including unmatched rows from the right table with NULL values.


- What is an ORM? What do they do?

 An ORM, or Object-Relational Mapping, is a programming technique and tool that simplifies the interaction between a relational database and the programming language used to build applications. The main purpose of an ORM is to bridge the gap between the object-oriented programming paradigm used in many programming languages


- What are some differences between making HTTP requests using AJAX 
  and from the server side using a library like `requests`?
  
  AJAX is used for client-side interactions in web browsers to fetch or send data without refreshing the entire page, enhancing user experience. Server-side libraries like requests are used to make HTTP requests from the server, often for integrating external APIs or performing server-side tasks that don't rely on the client's interactions.
  

- What is CSRF? What is the purpose of the CSRF token?

 CSRF stands for Cross-Site Request Forgery, which is a type of web security vulnerability. It occurs when an attacker tricks a user into performing actions on a web application without their knowledge or consent. This is done by taking advantage of the user's existing authenticated session on a website.

 To mitigate CSRF attacks, web applications use a security measure called a CSRF token. A CSRF token is a unique token generated by the server and embedded into web forms or URLs in a web application. The purpose of the CSRF token is to validate that the request is legitimate and originated from the same application, rather than being initiated by an attacker.


- What is the purpose of `form.hidden_tag()`?

 In the context of web development using Python's Flask framework (or similar frameworks like WTForms), form.hidden_tag() is a function that generates an HTML <input> element with a hidden type. This hidden input element is typically used to include a CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) token within a form.
